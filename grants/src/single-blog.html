      <p class="mb-8">Hi Everyone!</p>
      <p class="mb-8">Grant includes work on Funding Rates page, Rewards & Tracking Simulator, and CLI Trading tool. All will be combined in a community accessible webpage that will continue to host additional work done and maintenance on behalf of Chaos Labs.</p>
      <p class="mb-8">Funding Rates page will help promote and guide traders around Perpetual premiums found across all assets traded on dYdX. Rewards & Tracking simulator will help market the benefits of trading on dYdX and assist current traders in mapping out their rewards. The CLI trading tool will make it easier for non-UI based traders to execute quickly on dYdX. The general purpose of this grant is to recruit Chaos Labs, a very qualified contributor, to work with dYdX on current and future projects.</p>
      <p class="mb-8">We’re also happy to share that the Committee revamp is close to getting finalized. This revamp will enable payments to be complete by the Grants multisig. The team is working on the final documentation and will share everything with the community as soon as its ready. We’re excited to finally start paying our Grantees to really get things going!</p>
